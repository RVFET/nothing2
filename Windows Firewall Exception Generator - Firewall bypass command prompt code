Windows Firewall Exception Generator creates command line code that create rules to allow a specific exe to
access the internet and bypass the Firewall restriction. This is part of Batch Generator by Privateloader.

From Windows Help
When you add an app to the list of allowed apps in a firewall —sometimes called unblocking— you
allow a specific app to send info to or from your PC through the firewall.

How to?
Specify a filename and a filepath

Example:
filename : rundll32
filepath : c:\windows\system32\rundll32.exe
