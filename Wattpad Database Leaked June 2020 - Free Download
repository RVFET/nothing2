In June 2020, the user-generated stories website Wattpad suffered a huge data breach that exposed almost
270 million records. The data was initially sold then published on a public hacking forum where it was
broadly shared. The incident exposed extensive personal information including names and usernames, email
and IP addresses, genders, birth dates and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes.

I would like to warn users this leak is over 119.41GB uncompressed and 22.05GB compressed.

Compromised data: Bios, Dates of birth, Email addresses, Genders, Geographic locations, IP addresses,
Names, Passwords, Social media profiles, User website URLs, Usernames
